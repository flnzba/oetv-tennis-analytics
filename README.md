# Data Visualization App with Streamlit

This application is designed to scrape ranking data from the ﾃ傍V website, store it locally in a SQLite database, and display the data through a bar chart on a Streamlit web app. This setup provides an easy-to-use interface for analyzing and visualizing the data, all containerized with Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Automatically scrapes data from the specified ﾃ傍V rankings webpage.
- **Data Storage**: Uses SQLite for efficient local data storage.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes the data in a bar chart format using Matplotlib.
- **Web Application**: Streamlit framework provides a user-friendly web interface.
- **Docker Support**: Everything is dockerized for easy setup and portability.

## Analytics

1. Normalized Ranking
2. If I have an ITN of X then I am better then Y% of players
3. If I have an ITN of X then I am better then Y% of players in my age group
4. If I have an ITN of X then I am better then Y% of players in my region
5. Change of number of players since last Date X

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.12.7+
Optional:
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- node (if you want to test the fetch directly via js -> app.js)

## Side Info
- app.js is a testing script to fetch directly via js to make sure the response is correct
- app.py is the main script to fetch the data and store it in a sqlite database

## Structure
The application is built on a somewhat 3-layer architecture:
- **Data Layer**: This layer is responsible for fetching the data from the ﾃ傍V website and storing it as backup in a json.
- **Business Layer**: This layer is responsible for processing the data and performing any necessary calculations. We also load and transform the data from json to a SQLite database in this layer.
- **Presentation Layer**: This layer is responsible for displaying the data in a user-friendly format using Streamlit.

   ```
   Access the app at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage

After launching the app, the interface will allow you to view the bar chart representing the frequency of rankings from the ﾃ傍V website. Data is refreshed each time the application is restarted, ensuring you always have the latest rankings displayed.
